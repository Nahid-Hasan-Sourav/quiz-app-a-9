## About this project

 -In the project I am using react,react-router,lottie animation,hero icon,bootstrap-5 etc.
 -I load data from an API through React Router loader.  Then I  give it access to a parent component and send it to a component to display that data.

 -Here are some quiz topics.  Clicking on that topic will bring up some questions. And if you click on the options of the questions and also if you click on the one that is right, a toast will open showing the correct ans.

 -Here are the blog and statistics pages.
I have shown in a bar chart how many questions a topic has on the statistics page.
The blog page has three questions with their answers
